# smart-farm
These are python code for my smart farm project.
farm7scom.py is code that send data to the Mysql database in my laptop.
farm7ws2.py is code that Raspberrypi use to control each of my smartfarm's module(equipment).
farm8.py is "ideal" code that can control smartfarm altogether with sending data to the database.
farm8_2.py is the same as farm8.py, but use "try" to prevent si7021 i2c error.
